# Loading receipts into excel to manage expenditure
Many companies need to track their spending by inputting data from receipts into an Excel file and creating tables to manage their expenditure. Manually typing the required information from receipts into Excel can be a time-consuming process. Using Python as a tool to automate this process is a smart move that can save you time, allowing you to focus on other tasks.

In this project, I have selected some of my own receipts from supermarket shopping to demonstrate how this process works and how you can apply these steps to automate this time-consuming process.
